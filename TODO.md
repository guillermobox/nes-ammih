# TODO

As I barely work in this project I have a TODO list here that I update every
now and then.

## General

- Remove the cc65 dependency with an in-house assembler

## Graphics

- Change PPU rendering to not need the PPU_ENCODED_LEN
- Introduce basic animations for the characters
- Create a title screen

## Text

- Change format to have length instead of 0xff at the end
