# A Match Made In Heaven

This is a basic puzzle-like NES game.

To compile, the [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git) suite should be installed. There is a requirement to deal with the python Pillow package but it will be handled by make. This way just running `make` produces `ammih.nes`.

## The game

This is a puzzle game consisting on two characters that move synchronously. On
each stage there are exit locations, and the objective is to put both characters
at the same time in those locations.

## Gameplay

Just use the arrows to move both characters around.
